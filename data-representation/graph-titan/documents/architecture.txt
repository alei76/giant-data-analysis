Between Titan and the disks sits one or more storage and indexing adapters. 
Titan comes standard with the following adapters, but Titan’s modular architecture supports third-party adapters.

Data storage:

(1) Cassandra
(2) HBase
(3) BerkeleyDB

Indices, which speed up and enable more complex queries:

(1) Elasticsearch
(2) Lucene

Broadly speaking, applications can interact with Titan in two ways:

(1) Embed Titan inside the application executing Gremlin queries directly against the graph within the same JVM. 
Query execution, Titan’s caches, and transaction handling all happen in the same JVM as the application while data retrieval 
from the storage backend may be local or remote.

(2) Interact with a local or remote Titan instance by submitting Gremlin queries to the server. 
Titan natively supports the Gremlin Server component of the Tinkerpop stack.
