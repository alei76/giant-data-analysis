> Apache Spark is a fast and general-purpose cluster computing system. It provides high-level APIs in Java, Scala, Python and R, and an optimized engine that supports general execution graphs. It also supports a rich set of higher-level tools including **Spark SQL** for SQL and structured data processing, **MLlib** for machine learning, **GraphX** for graph processing, and **Spark Streaming**.
